# Question Editing Guide

A step-by-step guide for editing multiple question sets together into one
unified question set:

1. Immediately delete duplicates. If you sort your questions by "Reference" in
   the CBQZ Questions Editor, you will get all questions for each verse sorted
   alphabetically within each question type. This will allow you to easily identify
   duplicates.
2. Identify near-duplicates and choose between the options. Many questions will
   be VERY similar but not exact. You will want to decide how strict to be.
   Examples of near-duplicates include:
    - Questions that start slightly different but ultimately test the same material:
      "For God so loved what?" vs. "God so loved what?"
    - Questions that start in the same place but end in different places: "God so
      loved the world that what?" vs. "God so loved what?"
    - Questions that are the inverse of each other: "God so loved what?" vs. "Who so
      loved the world?"
3. Out of the remaining questions, delete any that you simply don't like. Maybe
   you don't like the phrasing, or you think it's too tricky, or you think there
   are too many questions orienting around a particular phrase or sentence. It's
   common for CR questions to be based off vague chapter-unique words and be
   unreasonably difficult as a result. Be a little more lenient on CRMA and CVRMA
   questions, since there aren't as many of those to begin with.
4. Check the remaining questions for validity, and delete or edit as needed. The
   quality of these questions should be high but there will inevitably be a few
   mistakes. Use every tool at your disposal to make this go quicker. If an INT or
   MA has a unique word in the first 5 words, there's no need to search the text.
   If it's a 2-word CR and the non-interrogative word is red, that means it's a
   chapter-unique word and you don't need to look it up. Here's some considerations
   and common things that invalidate questions:
    - The writer mislabeled the type of reference, e.g. the question asks for
      "Hebrews chapter 1 verse 5" but is marked as a CR
    - The question is marked as an INT but actually should be an MA, or vice-versa.
      (If the grammar is ambiguous and you can't decide one way or the other, it's
      probably best to delete the question.)
    - The question does not contain a unique phrase in the first 5 words. Phrases
      are defined as 3-word segments. So if the first 5 words of a question are
      unique to that verse, BUT none of the sets of 3 in those first 5 words are
      unique, it's still invalid. E.g. 1 Peter 3:20, "To those who were disobedient
      when?" the phrase "to those who were disobedient" is unique, but NONE of the
      phrases "to those who", "those who were", or "who were disobedient" are
      unique, so that question is invalid.
    - If the text uses the word "Spirit" with a capital S, that is a reference to
      the Holy Spirit and it is improper to use the interrogative "what" in these
      instances. This includes instances where "the Spirit" is a part of an MA, e.g.
      in John 4:24 "His worshippers must worship in the Spirit and in truth", the
      question "His worshippers must worship in what?" is invalid and should be
      written as "His worshippers must worship how?" instead.
    - Questions which are technically valid and "work" within the rules of quizzing
      but convey misleading information should be avoided. The textbook example is
      Hebrews 12:16, "Who is sexually immoral?" with the answer "No one." Again,
      this is perhaps not "invalid," but is definitely on the border of "tricky or
      misleading" and should be considered substandard and promptly deleted.
5. Ensure that the formatting is consistent:
    - Every question (other than Finish and Quote types) should end with a question
      mark.
    - Every answer (other than Finish and Quote types) should end with a period.
    - The answer should include only what the quizzer NEEDS to say to be counted
      correct. If the answer jumps around the verse, as is common with MA questions,
      use commas to separate the different parts of the answer. E.g. 2 Peter 2:1,
      "False what?" A: "Prophets, apostles."
    - Clarifications of pronouns should be indicated right after the pronoun in
      brackets [], NOT parentheses (). The material itself sometimes has
      parenthetical statements, but never brackets, so using brackets prevents any
      confusion. Clarifications are important but easy for writers to overlook, so
      add any clarifications you feel are important to the meaning of the question.
    - Reference questions should have the leading text: "According to Hebrews,
      chapter X, verse Y," before the question.
