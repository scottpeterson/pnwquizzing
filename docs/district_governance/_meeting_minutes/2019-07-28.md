    - Master of ceremonies – Gryphon for Scramble; will ask Jon VS for Meet 1
    - Quiz equipment and supplies – Sarah
    - Master of bibs – Sharalyn
    - Statistics – Scott; paper statistics remain gold standard, CBQZ scoring as backup
- Recruiting – Moses Lake likely for next season, Walla Walla maybe, Naches unsure, Sequim still trying
- Great West – likely at Crowsnest, dates unsure, questions may not be as awful
- Adult quizzing – possibly try this year, do not want it to distract from youth quizzing

- Rulebook
    - Will discuss question distribution further with rules committee
    - Benefit to changing to international rules regarding question distribution
    - Would encourage quizzers who only memorize key verses to have more opportunity to jump
    - It is a hardship for quizzers who learn all the material may not jump as fast on FTV type questions
    - Internationals makes more sense to have more FTV due to not having a specific list
